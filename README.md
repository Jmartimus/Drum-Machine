This is the Drum Machine app!  

It was fun to build and fun to play with.  

You can click the buttons in the drum machine or press those keys on the keyboard and they are heard by an event listener which renders a specific audio clip.  Each time that a key is pressed or a button is clicked, it replaces the sound that was being played previously.  This allows you to play it like an actual drum set.

Have fun playing with the drum machine!
